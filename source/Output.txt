And became bankrupt in the end.
And didn't bore him with strict moral,
And do not make a step aside!
And think: Oh gosh, when will you die!
At first, a Madame cared and nursed,
At least three balls used to give yearly
But after falling gravely ill
But North is not for me, they say.
But what a boredom is the session:
By Zeus’s supreme will elected
Didn’t want to spoil the child’s rest,
Eugene’s fate, though, was well disposed:
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Here is my novel in verse hero,
His father served exactly fairly
Is craving homage, and has found
It’s where I also used to play,
It is for others a good lesson,
It was what a young rake expected,
Let me acquaint you with the one:
Monsieur l'Abbé was not too formal
My uncle used to be so sound,
Or where you used to shine and revel.
Preferred to teach him just in jest
Relying mostly on a debt,
Reproved for pranks by gentle talk
That could not make a better deal.
The boy was frisky, but still sweet.
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila”!
The only heir of all his kin.
Then, paltry French cared for the kid.
To entertain a half deceased,
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
To Summer Garden took for walk.
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
To watch a sick man day and night
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
What mean deceitfulness it is:
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
With no preface and just right now
